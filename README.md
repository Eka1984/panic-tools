## Why this app exists

I build _Just Breathe_ as a practical tool for moments when anxiety or panic makes it hard to think clearly. The goal is to create something minimal and gentle: no overwhelming options, no noise, just a few techniques that are easy to follow when you need them most.

This project is also a way for me to explore how thoughtful UI, animation, and structure can support users in emotionally sensitive situations.
